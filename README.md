# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages. Sorting algorithms are essential concepts in computer science and programming as they enable efficient organization and arrangement of data in ascending or descending order.

## List of Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Insertion Sort**: Another comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by taking elements from the unsorted part and inserting them into their correct position in the sorted part.

3. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sorted and unsorted sublists. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together to obtain the sorted result.

5. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element, partitions the input list around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sublists on either side of the pivot.

6. **Heap Sort**: This algorithm uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements in ascending or descending order. It repeatedly extracts the maximum (for ascending order) or minimum (for descending order) element from the heap and places it at the end of the list.

7. **Shell Sort**: An extension of insertion sort that allows the exchange of elements that are far apart. It sorts elements in multiple passes with decreasing step sizes.

8. **Radix Sort**: This non-comparative integer sorting algorithm sorts data by processing individual digits or groups of digits. It sorts numbers by their place values from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

## How to Use

Each sorting algorithm implementation is placed in its respective folder. Inside each folder, you will find the source code files and any necessary instructions on how to compile and run the code. Additionally, the repository provides sample input files and corresponding outputs for you to test the algorithms.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you want to add more sorting algorithm implementations, improve existing code, or fix any issues, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and adheres to the coding conventions of the respective programming language.
